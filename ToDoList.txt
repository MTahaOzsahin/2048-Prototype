Will fix:


1.Need to check which grid layout has played when player exit then load to that grid layout.I guess i need to separate start to two way. One for reopening game and the other one for in game start(like new button or grid button.)




Fixed:

1. Will check if there any mergicable block before decided to lose game.

2.Undo function.

2.Check application.onQuit is called direct during force stop.(Force stop mean homescreen button).

3.Current score will reset after new scene loaded.

3.Scaleable canvases for any phone.

5.Win conditions will change according to grid layout.

3.Win screen always show up after getting win conditions regardless wanted to keep playing.

6.If no blocks are moving when a direction is pressed the game still spawns a new block, this should not happen.
