Will fix:

1.will add undo function.

4.Sounds add up each other while merging if there is more than one merge.


On Going:

Fixed:

3.Current score will reset after new scene loaded.

5.Win conditions will change according to grid layout.

3.Win screen always show up after getting win conditions regardless wanted to keep playing.

6.If no blocks are moving when a direction is pressed the game still spawns a new block, this should not happen.
